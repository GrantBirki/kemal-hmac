A base template for building applications, services, command line utilities, or libraries in [crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal).

## About ‚≠ê

This template is designed to be a starting point for quickly getting your project off the ground in crystal-lang. It includes a number of features to help you get started quickly:

- ‚öôÔ∏è Helper scripts for bootstrapping, testing, linting, formatting, and building your project
- üèÉ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows for testing, building, linting, and running acceptance tests
- üß™ A basic test structure
- üê≥ General purpose docker files for packing your crystal project into a container
- üì¶ An opinionated dependency vendoring strategy because "you" own your availability

## Dependency Vendoring üì¶

This project uses a highly opinionated dependency vendoring strategy. This strategy is designed to ensure that you own your availability and can always build your project. This strategy is as follows:

1. All dependencies are vendored into the project into the `vendor/shards/cache/` directory
2. The `vendor/shards/cache/` directory is committed to the repository to ensure that all dependencies are available to build the project forever. These shards are in `<name>-<version>.shard` format and take inspiration from a Ruby "Gem" when they are vendored.
3. The `script/bootstrap` command installs vendored dependencies with `SHARDS_CACHE_PATH="vendor/.cache/shards" shards install ...` to ensure that each project has its own cache and does not interfere with other crystal projects
4. The `script/update` command will re-vendor all dependencies and update the vendored dependencies in the repository. This will always result is changes to all dependencies, even if the version has not changed. This is to ensure that the vendored dependencies are always up to date and can be used to build the project.

## Docker Strategy üê≥

This project also includes general purpose docker files for packing your crystal project into a container. The docker files are as follows:

- `Dockerfile` - A general purpose docker file for building and running your crystal project
- `docker-compose.yml` - A docker compose file for running your crystal project in a container (base configuration)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` - A docker compose file for running your crystal project in a container (override configuration, extends the base by default - good for development)
- `docker-compose.production.yml` - A docker compose file for running your crystal project in a container (production configuration, extends the base by default - must be used explicitly)

This project more or less assumes that all crystal projects will be run in a container. This is because crystal is a compiled language and the compiled artifacts are not *always* portable across different systems. Running your crystal project in a container ensures that the compiled artifacts are portable and can be run anywhere. The main Dockerfile also uses a multi-stage build to ensure that the final image is as small as possible and generally only contains the compiled artifacts.

> Hint: the `Makefile` can be used to quickly start the development docker compose stack with `make run` (use `make stop` to stop the stack)

## Usage üíª

### Setup

Run the following command to bootstrap this repository and install all dependencies:

```bash
script/bootstrap
```

### Updating Dependencies

Run the following command to update all dependencies (shards):

```bash
script/update
```

### Testing

Run the following command to run all unit tests:

```bash
script/test
```

Run the following command to run all acceptance tests:

```bash
script/acceptance
```

### Linting and Formatting

Run the following command to lint the project:

```bash
script/lint

script/lint --fix # to fix any linting errors
```

Run the following command to format the project:

```bash
script/format

script/format --check # to check if any files need to be formatted without formatting them
```

### Building

Run the following command to create a release build:

```bash
script/build
```

### All-in-one

Run the following command to run all of the above commands at once except for `script/build`:

```bash
script/all
```

This will lint and format the project, followed by running all unit tests.

## Contributing ü§ù

To get started quickly with this project, you will need the following installed:

- [crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal) ([crenv](https://github.com/crenv/crenv) is suggested)
- [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)
- [zip](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/zip)

To get your repo setup for development do the following:

1. Clone the repo
2. Ensure your version of crystal matches the version in [`.crystal-version`](.crystal-version)
3. Run the following command:

  ```bash
  script/bootstrap
  ```

1. Congrats you're ready to start developing!
2. Write some code
3. Run `script/test` to run unit tests and ensure your changes work
4. Run `script/lint` to ensure your changes follow the style guide
5. Run `script/format` to ensure your changes are formatted correctly
6. Run `script/acceptance` to run the acceptance test suite
7. Open a pull request üéâ
